            <ul class="pr">
                <li class="produkti">Cannelloni</li>
                <li class="produkti">Farfalle</li>
                <li class="produkti">Fusilli</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 class="st">Today, pasta exists in over 400 forms and whether or not
			whether it is spaghetti or horse mackerel, farfalle or penne, they are all prepared
			in the same way - from durum wheat, water and salt. But some are thinner,
			others thicker, some absorb more of the sauces, others of the aromas... And
			so - hundreds of types, hundreds of flavors. Here are the most popular of them:
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h1 class="glawno">Cannelloni</h1>
			<br>
            <img src="https://s.shopeee.com/CTjP">
			<br>
            <h2 class="st">They are long, wide and hollow tube-shaped pasta
			with a length of 7 to 10 cm. They are prepared like all other types of pasta and most often
			served stuffed with mushrooms, ricotta, spinach, minced meat or salmon. According to the traditional
			their recipe are covered with cheese sauce and baked in the oven.</h2>
			<h2 class="st">A piece of chicken, vegetables or any kind of meat are suitable for filling
			the cannelloni. But of course, it takes time and patience to put the stuffing in
			the cannelloni. This is most easily done by holding the tube in one hand and with the other
			fill the cannelloni one by one with a tablespoon.</h2>
			
			<h1 class="glawno">Farfalle</h1>
			<br>
            <img src="https://s.shopeee.com/out6">
			<br>
            <h2 class="st">Farfalle are short pastas that are cut into squares and
			then they are pressed in the middle. This makes the thickness of this paste less in
			edges and more significant in the center. Farfalle are preferred by lovers of fine dining
			and original cuisine, probably because they manage to keep the sauce in their </h2>
			<h2 class="st">They are extremely tasty in whatever combination you prepare them, but
			to get the most out of them, it's best to make them part of fine dining
			- in a salad, with Saint-Jacques mussels, with shrimps or with salmon. You can also serve them with a roast
			chicken, with duck or with olives, almonds and vegetables.</h2>
			
			<h1 class="glawno">Fusilli</h1>
			<br>
            <img src="https://cuts.top/Gqf3">
			<br>
            <h2 class="st">Fusilli are most often about 7 cm long, about 5 mm thick, and twisted
			in the form of a spiral. They are one of the types of pasta most valued in Italy and without a doubt
			one reason for this is that they can pair with rich sauces and combine
			with various original products.</h2>
			<h2 class="st">For example, fusilli can become a real delicacy by
			served with caviar and arugula, with pecorino (a type of hard Italian cheese), cherry tomatoes, with vegetables,
			leek and cheddar cheese. And maybe with lamb ragout, almonds and feta cheese. You can also prepare fusilli with
			tuna, turkey, beef or pork liver and even make them part of a salad.</h2>
			
			<h1 class="glawno">Penne</h1>
			<br>
            <img src="https://cuts.top/Gqfk">
			<br>
            <h2 class="st">They are long, thin with the shape of tubes and are cut diagonally at the end, which their
			gives a slightly dynamic shape. They hold the sauce very well and are light on spice.</h2>
			<h2 class="st">Serve them with tomato sauce with chili pepper, and maybe with a few drops of cream
			vodka, Carbonara, with Saint Jacques mussels, with shrimp or simply with a bouquet of mushrooms. And maybe with eggplant,
			cauliflower and Bechamel sauce.</h2>
